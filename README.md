# Source-localization-using-WSN
A two-step source localization process is proposed in this work for counter-sniper applications:
The Time Difference Of Arrival (TDOA) values are firrst determined using the Generalized Cross Correlation (GCC) method.
The TDOA values are used by a hybrid spherical interpolation/maximum likelihood (SI/ML) estimation method to
determine the shooter location
